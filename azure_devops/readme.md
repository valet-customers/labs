## Use Valet with a codespace

1. Start the codespace
    - Click the `Code` with button down arrow above repository on the repository's landing page.
    - Click the `Codespaces` tab
    - Click `Create codespaces on main` to create the codespace. If you are in another branch then the `main` branch, the codespace will button will have the current branch specified.
    - Wait a couple minutes, then verify that the codespace starts up. Once it is fully booted up, the termininal should be present.
2. Verify Valet CLI is installed and working. More information on the [GitHub Valet CLI extension](https://github.com/github/gh-valet)
    -  Verify Valet CLI is installed and working
    -  Run `gh valet version` in the Visual Studio Code terminal and verify the output looks like the below image. Note the valet version will be different than below as the latest version gets pulled down.
       -  If `gh valet version` did not produce a similar image with a version please follow these instructions [Troubleshoot GH Valet extension](#troubleshoot-gh-valet-extension)
    -  Start using Valet by following along with the [Labs for Azure DevOps](#labs-for-azure-devops)
    
### Example ###
