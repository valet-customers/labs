# Welcome to Valet labs!
These Valet labs let you test-drive Valet by bootstrapping the environment of your choosing. The steps to get started with the Valet labs are:
1. Get access to Valet and create your own GitHub Repository. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.
2. Bootstrap your environment. The default page of the lab of your choosing will detail how to configure and run the action to bootstrap the environment. Currently these labs support [Azure DevOps](azure_devops).
3. Run Valet via Codespaces. The codespace has docker running and will update to the latest Valet environment.
4. Proceed with running the labs!

# Prerequisites
1. Valet is currently private and customers must be onboarded prior to using the gh-valet CLI extension. Please reach out to [GitHub Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact) to inquire about being granted access.
2. Create your own GitHub Repository in your own GitHub Organization or under your user with Codespaces enabled using this Repository as a template. To do so: 
   - Navigate to the top of this Repository click `Use this template`
   - Select the owner of the new Reposiotry. It could be your personal username or an Organization you belong to.
   - Name the Repository
   - Click `Create repository froom template`
   - Proceed to the labs inside of your new Repository.
