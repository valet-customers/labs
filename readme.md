# GitHub Actions migrations powered by Valet

Valet helps facilitate the migration of Azure DevOps, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Travis CI pipelines to GitHub Actions. This repository contains learning paths that teach you how to use Valet and how to approach migrations to Actions.

> Valet is currently private and you must be onboarded prior to using it. Please reach out to [GitHub Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact) to inquire about being granted access.

To get started:

1. Use the `valet-customers/labs` repository as a template to [generate](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/generate) a new GitHub repository.
2. Select which learning path to begin with. There are currently learning paths for:
   - [Migrations from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions](/azure_devops/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from CircleCI to GitHub Actions](/circle_ci/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from GitLab CI to GitHub Actions](/gitlab/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from Jenkins to GitHub Actions](/jenkins/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from Travis CI to GitHub Actions](/travis/readme.md)
3. Each learning path describes how to configure your codespace, bootstrap a CI/CD environment, and troubleshoot the Valet CLI.
