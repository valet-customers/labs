# GitLab to Actions migrations powered by Valet

These instructions will guide you through configuring the GitHub Codespaces environment that will be used in these labs that demonstrate how to use Valet to migrate GitLab pipelines to GitHub Actions.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting other labs.

## Create your own repository for these labs

- Ensure that you have created a repository using [valet-customers/labs](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs) as a template.

## Configure your codespace

1. Start a new codespace

- Click the `Code` button on your repository's landing page.
- Click the `Codespaces` tab.
- Click `Create codespaces on main` to create the codespace.
- After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.

2. Verify the Valet CLI is installed and working. More information on the Valet extension for the official GitHub CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/github/gh-valet).

- Run the following command in the codespace terminal:

  ```bash
  gh valet version
  ```

- Verify the output is similar to below.
  
  ```bash
  gh version 2.14.3 (2022-07-26)
  gh valet        github/gh-valet v0.1.12
  valet-cli       unknown
  ```

  - If `gh valet version` did not produce similar output, please refer to the troubleshooting [guide](#troubleshoot-the-valet-cli).

## Bootstrap a GitLab server

1. Execute the GitLab setup script that will start a container with GitLab running inside of it. The script should be executed when starting a new codespace or restarting an existing one.

- Run the following command from the codespace terminal:
  
  ```bash
  source ./gitlab/bootstrap/setup.sh
  ```

- After some time, a pop-up box should appear with a link to the URL for your GitLab server.
  - You can also access the URL by going to the `Ports` tab in your terminal. Right-click the URL listed under the `Local Address` and click the `Open in Browser` tab.

2. Open the GitLab server in your browser and use the following credentials to authenticate:

  - Username: `root`
  - Password: `valet-labs!`

- Once authenticated, you should see a GitLab server with a few predefined pipelines in the `valet` group.

## Labs for GitLab

Perform the following labs to learn more about Actions migrations with Valet:

1. [Configure credentials for Valet](1-configure.md)
2. [Perform an audit on GitLab pipelines](2-audit.md)
3. [Perform a dry-run migration of a GitLab pipeline](3-dry-run.md)
4. [Use custom transformers to customize Valet's behavior](4-custom-transformers.md)
5. [Perform a production migration of a GitLab pipeline](5-migrate.md)
6. [Forecast potential build runner usage](6-forecast.md)

## Troubleshoot the Valet CLI

The CLI extension for Valet can be manually installed by following these steps:

- Verify you are in the codespace terminal
- Run this command from within the codespace terminal:

  ```bash
  gh extension install github/gh-valet
  ```

- Verify the result of the install contains:

  ```bash
  âœ“ Installed extension github/gh-valet
  ```

- If you get an error similar to the image below, click the link in the terminal output to authorize the token.
  - Restart the codespace after clicking the link.

- Verify Valet CLI extension is installed and working by running the following command from the codespace terminal:

  ```bash
  gh valet version
  ```
